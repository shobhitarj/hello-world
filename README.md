# hello-world
first shot at GIT
So..this is how a journey has to begin..with a certain amount of naivity and uncertainity.
This is what adds not only to the excitement but also to the determination...Determination to learn..to grow..to evolve..to get accustomed!!
n yet find new and unexpected things along the shore!!
BUT..THEN..YOU WILL ASK...WHATS THE WHOLE POINT OF IT!??
TO WHICH i WILL SAY...MAYBE thats what we have undertaken the journey for....
to figure out....what ws the point of it all..or rather what point it should make for us..
SO ..in a way...we choose..though very subtlely..what a Journey would bring to us....and what will it render to us...
now you will ask...but sometimes...we dont even choose to undertake one...but we find ourselves...moving along through it...
Well..then you must realise...that these journies are the very mark of our existence.
n it was never about choosing to be on one...you already are...u already were...
it ws just the matter of realisation..and also the fact that all dat you percieve as being a journey is a subset of your larger one!!
